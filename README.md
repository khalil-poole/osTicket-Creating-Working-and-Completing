Next, we're going to login the Admin in order to see the ticket that was submitted to the system here

Take a look at the various options we have. We can change the SLA priority level, ticket status, the due date, assign tickets to different teams, etc. 

We can also reply to Karen, or internally where only the Admin and Agents can see. Feel free to explore and when you're ready let's close the ticket.
